        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Back in my early days, I was a former child. Growing up and being alive was an every day thing. The days were long and tiring. PLaying with toys, watching tv and causing mischief were among those long days.</p>
            <p>Every now and then I get the urge to relive those moments long past, and cook up a recipe from that era. That recipe is hot dog. A classic and a staple in every day life.</p>
            <p>Join me as we embark on a hot dog recipe journey of the likes you have never seen.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Hot Dog</li>
                <li>Hot Dog Bun</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Ketchup</li>
                <li>Other toppings you desire within</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heatup a pan of water, enough to cover any dogs you will throw in once boiling.</li>
                <li>One you get that water boiling, throw in the dogs. And let them boil for 2-3 minutes</li>
                <li>Pull the hot dogs out, use tongs or your hands if you are determined to show them who's boss. (<em>Please don't use your hands</em>)</li>
                <li>Place each dog onto its own bun and hit it with a stripe of ketchup. Add any additional desired toppings if you'd like, although I don't know why you'd want to ruin a perfectly good hot dog.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
